To maintain absolute integrity and focus for this repository, the following rules are MANDATORY:

### 🚫 PROHIBITED (KHÔNG)
- **❌ Không nói AI học**: We do not discuss training, epochs, or "learning" during this phase. Focus on execution only.
- **❌ Không backtest**: No historical simulations or theoretical results.
- **❌ Không history**: Do not dwell on past performance; current execution is the only truth.
- **❌ Không auto bot**: No autonomous execution without human-in-the-loop verification.

### ✅ MANDATORY (PHẢI)
- **✅ ONE signal**: Only one signal generated per session.
- **✅ ONE execution**: One deliberate act of placing the order.
- **✅ ONE video**: One continuous recording as the ultimate proof.

**GOAL**: Absolute transparency through manual verification.
*"This signal was placed LIVE."*
